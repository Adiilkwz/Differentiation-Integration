    "### 2. Analysis of Method Suitability\n",
    "\n",
    "In numerical differentiation, the choice between Newton's **Forward** and **Backward** interpolation formulas depends entirely on the location of the target point within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **For $t = 2.0$ s (Forward Method)**\n",
    "* **Location:** The point $t=2$ is located near the **beginning** of the dataset ($t_0=0$).\n",
    "* **Reasoning:** The Forward Difference method relies on data points *ahead* of the target value ($y_{i+1}, y_{i+2}, \\dots$). Since we have ample data available after $t=2$ (up to $t=16$), the Forward method converges effectively and uses the available future data points to refine the derivative. Using the Backward method here would be less accurate because there is very limited historical data before $t=2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **For $t = 14.0$ s (Backward Method)**\n",
    "* **Location:** The point $t=14$ is located near the **end** of the dataset ($t_{max}=16$).\n",
    "* **Reasoning:** The Backward Difference method relies on data points *behind* the target value ($y_{i-1}, y_{i-2}, \\dots$). Since we have a full history of data leading up to $t=14$, the Backward method is the mathematically correct choice. The Forward method would be unsuitable here because it would require data points beyond $t=16$, which do not exist in our observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Physical Interpretation\n",
    "* **Velocity:** The positive velocity at both instances indicates the particle is moving in the positive direction.\n",
    "* **Acceleration:** * At $t=2$, if the acceleration is **positive**, the particle is speeding up.\n",
    "    * At $t=14$, if the acceleration is **negative**, the particle is slowing down (decelerating)."
